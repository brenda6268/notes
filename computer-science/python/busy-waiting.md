```
while True:
    pass 
```

this is busy waiting

```
while True:
    time.sleep(10)
```

this is not busy waiting, bucause cpu are free to do other things, and only need trivial cpu cycles

busy waiting is considered as anti-pattern, but using it in spinning-lock is ok

should use select if we need to wait for something
