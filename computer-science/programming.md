##Yifei's Notes

There are two ways of becoming irreplaceable in what you are doing: 1. full stack; 2. An expert in some specific area.

Full stack
	Pros: you will be able start your own business
	Cons: you may know how, but you don't know why
Expertise
	Pros: you are irreplaceable in some area, there must be something that only you know
	Cons: you cannot fully bootstrap yourself
