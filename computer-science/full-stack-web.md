Server Side
------
0. language: CoffeeScript / Python / Golang

2. NoSQL DB: mongodb / couchdb
3. SQL DB: sqlite / MySQL
3. ORM: sqlalchmy, Django ORM

0. library management: bower
   > here is a tutorial: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/meet-bower-a-package-manager-for-the-web/
   > bower can install and _update_ from its own index or github or a single js file.
0. Library: jQuery, Underscore, Lodash
1. MVC framework: backbone, Vue / React
2. CSS framework: 
   > 1. just use bootstrap, which is the most popular, but too heavy;
   > 0. purecss.io
3. grid system
   > using purecss's grid system
4. Css preprocessor: less
   > sass vs. less
   > sass support two syntaxes: sass and scss, which is confusing. and relies on ruby.
   > less has only one syntax, which i think is uglier, but the compiler is available in js.
   > so the winner is **less**, **sass**

6. Polyfill for mobile app: fastclick etc.
7. Dependency Mangement: CommonJS / RequireJS

0. docker

Wow, two years ago, I was really in to node.js, now I know it's not the only future, and python still rocks

And I didn't even realize the mobile is king and the pc web is dying...
