So I started to learn OpenGL, but the red book and blue book is just too detailed. I googled around, and knew that modern OpenGL is preferred (version 3 and above), however, the old Nehe's tutorial which is about OpenGL 1.x is still everywhere. To help beginners from digging too much into the old and deprecated way, here is a list of tutorials targeting modern OpenGL:

* [Anton's OpenGL Tutorials](http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/)
    Great, updated frequently, but there is no source code provided. Good as a reference and starting point, but you just can't get anything up and running with it, you can just get the concept of how to do things in OpenGL.
* [open.gl](http://open.gl/)
    not complete, but worth a view, the source code is elegant. Uses GLFW as window management
* [OpenGL Tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org)
    Great, the code is horriable, but somehow they did make it clear about what they are doing. Uses GLFW and glm.
* [Tom Dalling's OpenGL Tutorials](http://tomdalling.com/blog/category/modern-opengl/)
    Great, short and covers the basics
* [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut)
    Great, intermediate
* [ogldev's OpenGL Step by Step](http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/index.html)
    Great, a little long(40 lessons), targeting linux
* [OpenGL 3 and OpenGL 4 with GLSL](http://nopper.tv/norbert/opengl.html )
    only source code, no guides, eclipse needed.
* [Scratch a Pixel](http://www.scratchapixel.com/)
    a website about math used in Computer Graphics
* [Swiftless's OpenGL Tutorial](http://www.swiftless.com/opengl4tuts.html)
    not complete, outdated
* [OpenGL Book](http://openglbook.com/the-book/)
    not complete
* [Joe's](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Table-of-Contents.html )
    not complete
