# a post from chromium forum

this is a lot good posts and suggestions on [this post][1]

> http://www.adonads.com says about 4000$ for each 100K active users.[source][1]

list of web extension platforms:

* [bitcro][2]
* [extension factory][3]
* [ext.guru][4]
* [addonsmash][5]


[Ghostery][9] seems to be easy to implement plugin, check out how does it make money?

mocking or copying some other extension can be a easy way to find what to do. REMEMBER: you don't have to take the whole market, you just have to take a small share to monetize~

I found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpal-xpath-generator-test/lpfjogcaifigkimnlkepjlkfhpdhebap">this extension</a> very useful, although it's a paid extension, it worth the cost. 

I would like to recommend <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpal-xpath-generator-test/lpfjogcaifigkimnlkepjlkfhpdhebap">this extension</a> very useful, It automatically generates xpath expressions for you by id or class or other attributes by simply clicking on the element you like, which is probably what you want to manually generate. besides, you can verify and modify the xpath expression it the plugin. Although it's a paid extension, it worth the cost.
