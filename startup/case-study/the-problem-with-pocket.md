I started using Pocket about six years ago. Back then it's a Firefox plugin named Read It Later. I saved about 1000+ articles to read-it-later. But until now, when I quit my job, I finally got some time to read those articles. Then I got this:

I thought that pocket's server would retrive the article for me, and store the copy so that I can read it when ever I got time. It turns out that I was wrong, Pocket only fetches the article on the computer or phone, it only stores the url in the cloud. That's too bad, a lot of my saved pages have gone 404ed.
