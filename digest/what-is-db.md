I'm reminded of being 18, my first year of college, and I had this lovely database professor who was good with crowds. He'd get us all to memorize and repeat, as a group certain phrases.
"Why do we normalize?"

150 students, in unison: "To make better relations"

"And why do we DE-normalize?"

150 students, in unison: "Performance"

"And what is a database?"

150 students, in unison: "A self-describing set of integrated records"

That was 16 years ago, and I'm still able to say those answers verbatim.
