Coding in C is like camping. It's fun for a while, but eventually you really miss things like flushing toilets and grocery stores. I like using C, but I get frustrated every time I hit a wall trying to build features from other languages. C is a very WET language.

C is basically it for embedded development though. I've gotten so tired of recompiling and waiting to flash a chip with C, that I've started learning ANTLR and making my own language. The idea is to have a language which runs in a VM written in C, and allows you to easily access code which has to be in C. Sort of like uPython, except it can easily be used on any board with a C compiler with a small amount of setup, and C FFI is a first class citizen. Also coroutines masquerading as first class actors with message passing, since I always end up building that in C anyway.
