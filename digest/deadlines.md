SO DON'T HAVE DEADLINES?
Don't be silly! Have deadlines, but fuzzy. How fuzzy should be decided by your goals. If missing a deadline could potentially lose you a million dollars, the fuzziness factor for that should be zero. If it's a new feature, there's always more scope of fuzziness. Another idea is to experiment with more elaborate probabilistic ways of setting shipping estimates rather than gut based estimates. [3]

But locking your sprints is not the way to go.

In my experience when people focus too much on sprint deadlines, they miss the purpose of sprints.
Timed sprints exist not for the benefits of managers, but for the benefit of developers. They exist so that the development team has a shield against managers making last-minute decisions and changing priorities without notice.

If the focus and discussion is regularly on short term deadlines, then the developers are not driving the process, the managers are. It means that sprints are seen as a management methodology and not a development methodology. And then everyone has a hard time.

Managers who think this way know they’re not “allowed” to make mid-sprint changes so instead they focus on the end/deadline.

The managers should be spending their energy supporting the team and figuring out what the priorities are for the next sprint(s). If they’re spending their mental energy on deadlines then they’re doing everyone involved a disservice.
